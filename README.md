# Project for Engineering Project

Original Released by Ali Bilal ArÄ± for python3:

At [this github repository](https://github.com/hemog/Stern/tree/hemog-patch-1) you can find a matlab version.


## Requirements

There is a requirements file for this package.
run "pip install -r requirements.txt"

## Running
Go to file directory where the main project file located
type "python3 2210386013_project3_alibilalari"

To run project you need two additional packages: `pytest` and `numpy`. After installing both, just run pytest in
the base directory. The tests use some fixed values from the documentation to make sure that every coefficient
and formula works as intended.

To test if installment was successful, run `python3 2210386013_project3_alibilalari`. This will require numpy and matplotlib to be installed.

## Usage
To run Project file you ought to choose which action you will do. If you want to check the properties properly you should remove comment notations (#) at the begging of the lines. See below for available functions.

# print("Fixed Value of P6 is 0.5 MPa")
# for T7_value in T7_values:
#    eta_th, m, w_net, q_net, w_p, w_t, q_L, q_H = calculate_eta_th(T7_value)       
#    print(f"For T7 = {T7_value} K, eta_th = {eta_th}, m = {m}, w_net = {w_net}, Qnet = {q_net}, w_p = {w_p}, w_t = {w_t}, q_L = {q_L},q_H = {q_H}")
